# Cocktail Finder App - Prompts and References

## Prompts Given During Development

1. Initial Request:
   - Created a responsive React web app for making cocktails with:
     - Apple-style UI
     - Search functionality
     - Custom data sources 
     - Mobile-responsive design

2. "Continue to iterate?"
   - Enhanced the app with styling and GitHub Pages deployment setup

3. "Create a local git repository and commit the changes so far"
   - Set up Git repository
   - Added .gitignore
   - Made initial commit of all files

4. "Update the search to include both the cocktail name and the ingredients. Also it should be 'and' logic instead of 'or', whatever the user has typed, it should all be present in the cards shown"
   - Implemented AND logic for search functionality
   - Fixed search behavior to work across cocktail name and ingredients

5. "commit these changes"
   - Committed AND logic implementation to Git

6. "Add a label as well with the commit, so it is easy to go back to these changes"
   - Added tag 'and-logic-v1.0' to mark the AND logic implementation

7. "check the repository, there seems to be a file missed in the commit, remove the label, commit the file to the repository and add the tag properly. Make sure to check no files are left out"
   - Fixed commit to include missing CocktailList.tsx file
   - Re-added the tag properly

8. "Instead of two search fields, 'Ingredients' and 'Cocktails' combine them into one"
   - Created UnifiedSearch component
   - Integrated both ingredient and cocktail search into one field
   - Updated App.tsx and CocktailList.tsx accordingly

9. "seeing compilation errors"
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in UnifiedSearch component
   - Added proper type assertions for search results

10. "when a cocktail is selected, it doesn't stick, the cards don't filter"
    - Updated UnifiedSearch component to handle cocktail selection
    - Added functionality to filter cards based on selected cocktail
    - Implemented visual indicator for selected cocktail

11. "commit these changes with a tag"
    - Committed unified search implementation
    - Added 'unified-search-v1.0' tag

12. "First list all the files that need to be committed, make sure there is nothing left behind, then commit these changes with a tag"
    - Listed all modified files
    - Committed complete changes with proper tag
